# üîê‚òÅÔ∏è Securing Data in AWS S3 Buckets

This project walks through securing an Amazon S3 bucket, a widely used cloud storage service. It covers the core steps for protecting stored data: creating a private bucket, enabling versioning, applying server-side encryption, managing access through policies, and configuring logging for audit purposes.

## üîß Tools & Skills
  - Platform: AWS S3
  - Security Features: Bucket policies, encryption (KMS), access logging
  - Skills: IAM permissions, cloud storage hardening, CLI basics

## üß™ Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Secure S3 Bucket

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
3. Click on "Create bucket".
4. Configure the bucket settings:
    - Bucket name: `my-secure-bucket`
    - Region: Select a region
    - Block all public access: Enable
5. Click "Create bucket".

### Exercise 2: Enable Bucket Versioning

1. Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
2. Select the bucket my-secure-bucket.
3. Click on "Properties".
4. Scroll down to "Bucket Versioning" and click "Edit".
5. Enable versioning and save changes.

*Bucket Versioning enabled.*

### Exercise 3: Enable Server-Side Encryption (SSE-KMS)

1. Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
2. Select the bucket my-secure-bucket.
3. Click on "Properties".
4. Scroll down to "Default encryption" and click "Edit".
5. Enable server-side encryption with AWS-KMS.
6. Choose a KMS key or create a new one.
7. Save changes.

*AWS-KMS encryption enabled.*

### Exercise 4: Set a Bucket Policy

1. Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
2. Select the bucket `my-secure-bucket`.
3. Click on "Permissions".
4. Scroll down to "Bucket policy" and click "Edit".
5. Add the following policy to allow read access for a specific user:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username"
          },
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
6. Save changes.

### Exercise 5: Enable Access Logging

1. Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
2. Select the bucket `my-secure-bucket`.
3. Click on "Properties".
4. Scroll down to "Server access logging" and click "Edit".
5. Enable access logging and specify a target bucket for logs (e.g., `my-log-bucket`).
6. Save changes.
