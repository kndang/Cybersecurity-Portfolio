# CJUST 315 - Security Plan For a Fictional Company

## 🔍 Overview

A comprehensive security plan for a fictional e-commerce company, **MyStore.com**, developed for a CJUST course. The plan integrates best practices from **NIST SP 800-86: Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response**, focusing on organizational readiness, asset protection, incident response, and digital forensic capability.
It demonstrates how to design a real-world security architecture that aligns with cybersecurity principles like **CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** and incorporates proactive and reactive strategies for detecting, responding to, and investigating security incidents.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Model a corporate enterprise and production network from a cybersecurity perspective.
- Identify critical digital assets and associated threats/vulnerabilities.
- Develop an incident response framework with digital forensics readiness.
- Apply **NIST 800-86 principles** for evidence collection, analysis, and reporting.
- Define roles, responsibilities, and procedures for forensic teams.
- Recommend technical and administrative controls (e.g., IDS, IPS, access policies).
