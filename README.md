üåê I am an aspiring IT professional with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Cyber Security. I have gained practical experience working with tools such as Kali Linux, Wireshark, Splunk, Azure, and AWS to develop and implement effective cybersecurity solutions.Through hands-on projects involving threat detection systems, penetration testing, and cloud security, I‚Äôve sharpened my skills in identifying vulnerabilities, managing risks, and crafting strong defense strategies.

üí° I thrive on solving complex problems and have experience developing fully functional programs, including an Android game and a memory allocator proram. I also have a solid foundation in cybersecurity, including cryptography, SQL injection, and IP networking.

üíª I have expertise in programming languages such as Python, Java, R, C, and C++, as well as web development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
