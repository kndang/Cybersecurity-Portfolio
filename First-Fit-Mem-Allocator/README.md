# First Fit Memory Allocator

## 📝 Project Prompt
> Write a first fit memory allocator. Your program will read in a sequence of memory allocation and dellocation commnds from a file. It will perform each command and display what memory looks like after each command.
> Included several text files to test.
    
## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Implemented python logic to allocate and deallocate memory using the first-fit algorithm 
- Understood how memory fragmentation affects allocation
  
## 🛠️Tools Used
- Python 3.x

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kndang/Cybersecurity-Portfolio.git
   cd Cybersecurity-Portfolio/First-Fit-Mem-Allocator

2. Make sure the m1.txt (or other text you choose instead) file is in the same directory as the program.
2. Run the script:
   
   `python cmsci356_project2.py`
