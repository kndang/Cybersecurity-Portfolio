# Project 3.1 (Doing Things in Order)

## 📝 Project Prompt
> Write a program that creates three threads. Each thread will begin by sleeping for a random amount of time between 0.1 and 2.0 seconds.  
> Then Thread 1 will print out "1 end", Thread 2 will print out "2 end", and Thread 3 will print out "3 end".  
> Use **condition variables or semaphores** to make sure that the printing happens in the 1, 2, 3 order.  
> The threads should all be started in the main part of the program.  
> Try varying the order the threads are started in to ensure the output is consistent.
